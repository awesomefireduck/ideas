# Project ideas

Here is a list of several ideas, some of which I might actually work on one day.

- vim plugin for firefox that uses an actual vim process so you can use your own plugins and stuff
- browser pulgin for [eccentric-authentication](github.com/gwitmond/eccentric-authentication) instead of the current proxy
