# Project ideas

Here is a list of several ideas, some of which I might actually work on one day.

- vim plugin for firefox that uses an actual vim process so you can use your own plugins and stuff
- browser pulgin for [eccentric-authentication](github.com/gwitmond/eccentric-authentication) instead of the current proxy
- Interactive visualisation of the seats in the [house of representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Netherlands)); not (just) per party, but per issue (e.g. more roads, more education, immigration policy)
