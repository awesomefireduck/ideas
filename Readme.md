# Project ideas

Here is a list of several ideas, some of which I might actually work on one day.

- vim plugin for firefox that uses an actual vim process so you can use your own plugins and stuff (use neovim's server-client model?)
- browser pulgin for [eccentric-authentication](github.com/gwitmond/eccentric-authentication) instead of the current proxy
- Interactive visualisation of the seats in the [house of representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Netherlands)); not (just) per party, but per issue (e.g. more roads, more education, immigration policy). Perhaps similar to the image on wikipedia: ![Image of seats coloured per party](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Tweede_Kamer_2015.svg)
- something with [PostgREST](https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest) and [ELM](http://elm-lang.org/) using [elm-postgrest](https://github.com/john-kelly/elm-postgrest). Perhaps with React/Vue? But what...?
